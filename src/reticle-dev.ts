  // the store your most important flow reads, and list the testids that flow touches. Add more later,
  // when a flow you actually replay needs them.

  // Registering a store is the highest-value line in this file: it lets the agent check what the app
  // BELIEVES, not just what it rendered — the class of bug a screenshot cannot see. Pass the STORE,
  // not `() => store.getState()`: the store form wires `subscribe` too, so every mutation emits a
  // state diff; the getter form is read-only and silently produces empty diffs.
  // No state library detected. If you add one, register it here — see docs/usage.md.
